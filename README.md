HTML/CSS validation for object submission is in object-submission-page/objection-submition-page.html
and object-submission-page/objection-submition-page.css (Required boxes are outlined in black, and invalied inputs have boxes with red outlines).

Live maps appear on the results page, and on objectsubmission page in object-submission-page/objection-submition-page.js and results-page/results-page.js. A hardcoded map for our example object page is in about-page/about-page.js
